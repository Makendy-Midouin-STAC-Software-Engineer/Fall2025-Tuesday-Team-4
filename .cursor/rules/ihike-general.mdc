Tech Stack: 
Frontend: Vite + React → UI and component logic, Tailwind CSS → styling, Mapbox GL JS → interactive map rendering
Backend: Django (Python) → web framework and API, Django REST Framework → REST API endpoints, PostgreSQL + PostGIS → relational + geospatial database
Deployment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk → backend hosting, Vercel → frontend hosting

General (Always Follow): 
Keep code efficient, simple, and easy to follow.
Do not over-engineer — build only what’s needed, keep solutions minimal and practical.
Use React functional components + hooks only (no class components).
Use only these hooks unless necessary: useState, useEffect, useRef.
Keep components small and modular.
Write reusable code when appropriate (e.g., shared components, helper functions, hooks) to avoid duplication.
Use Tailwind for all styling. No inline CSS or external frameworks.
Use camelCase for variables and file names.
Keep folder structure clean and consistent.
Write code that is self-explanatory and minimal.
No redundant abstractions or unnecessary logic.
Code should run without extra setup beyond this stack.
Comment only when logic isn’t immediately clear.
You are not able to see or modify .env files directly - so tell the user what they should add to the files if needed.
